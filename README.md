## Features

- **Efficient Quantization**: Convert models to float16, int8, and int4 formats.
- **On-Device Inference**: Optimized for iOS 18 and later.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup for developers.
- **Hugging Face Compatibility**: Leverage the power of Hugging Face transformers.

## Installation

To install the necessary tools and libraries, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ambv231/tinyllama-coreml-ios18-quantization.git
   cd tinyllama-coreml-ios18-quantization
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your machine.

4. Download the latest model files from the [Releases](https://github.com/ambv231/tinyllama-coreml-ios18-quantization/releases) section.

## Usage

After installation, you can begin using the TinyLlama model in your iOS applications. Here's a simple example of how to load and use the model:

```swift
import CoreML

guard let model = try? TinyLlama(configuration: MLModelConfiguration()) else {
    fatalError("Could not load model")
}

// Perform inference
let input = TinyLlamaInput(text: "Hello, world!")
let output = try? model.prediction(input: input)
print(output?.response ?? "No response")
```

## Model Details

### TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat

- **Parameters**: 1.1 billion
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based
- **Training Data**: Diverse datasets for improved language understanding

### Supported Formats

- **float16**: A half-precision floating-point format that reduces memory usage.
- **int8**: An 8-bit integer format for faster computations.
- **int4**: A 4-bit integer format for even smaller model sizes.

## Quantization Techniques

Quantization is the process of mapping a large set of values to a smaller set. In the context of machine learning, it helps in reducing the model size and improving inference speed without significantly sacrificing accuracy. 

### Techniques Used

1. **Post-Training Quantization**: This technique applies quantization after the model has been trained. It allows for efficient conversion with minimal loss in performance.

2. **Dynamic Quantization**: This approach quantizes weights on-the-fly during inference, allowing for flexibility and speed.

3. **Quantization-Aware Training**: This method involves training the model with quantization in mind, helping it adapt to the reduced precision.
